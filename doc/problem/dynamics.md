Project 3: Dynamics of AS Patterns
==================================

## Project Purpose:
Define and compare dynamics:
- for Active State and Inactive State separately
- between Active State and Inactive State
Formulate dynamics hypothesis based on different events

## Key Questions:
- How to classify the active and inactive events? For example, W(water) belongs to active state. Given a new event, how should we determine its AS/IS state?
- Which two events can be transformed from one to another? How to determine that there is a dynamics? For example, can W(water) be pointed to F(food) and why?
- Are there any similarities and differences between the within-state dynamics and the between-state dynamics? Will they have different patterns or different durations? Dash line and bold line?
- How to formulate and visualize dynamics hypothesis? For example, breakfast-hypothesis visualizes active state probability over time. 

## Exploratory Questions:
- For the graph in the slides, what do the circles represent, i.e events, probabilities?
- Do we need to classify different types of events under each state; for example, there are different types of circles in the graph, do they have specific distinctions?
- What does 129S1 stand for in the breakfast hypothesis plot? How many plots like this should we plot? Should we have one plot for each mouse or come up with an overall trend?
- Are there other features influencing dynamics?

## Data Collection:
<p>The data we have:</p>
- the location of each mouse
- the behavioral data for each mouse: different events over time
- Basic Time Bin Features:
9 (feature type) x 1921 (mouse day) x 11 (2 hour time bin) 
- Features: Food (F), Water (W), Distance (D) ASProbability (ASP), ASNumbers (ASN), ASDurations (ASD) ASFoodIntensity (ASFI), ASWaterIntensity (ASWI), MoveASIntensity (ASMI)

</p>The data we need:</p>
- More events/behavior over time 

## Initial tasks:
- Identify events and classified AS/IS states
- Separate within and between-state dynamics
- How to determine whether there is dynamics? For example, what if there is a peak just after one event or the line remains horizontal or highly fluctuate over time?
- Set up hypothesis between two events
- Use visualization or other statistical analysis tools to make sure the transformation exists
