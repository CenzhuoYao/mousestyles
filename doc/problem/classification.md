Project 5: Application of Machine Learning Algorithms
===============================================
This project aims to get some insights about the relation between the gene and the mouse behavior. 


1. Clean up the existing strain_classification.py: create functions and objects.
2. Adding new models: knn, random forests, neural networks.
3. Doing unsupervised learning: k-means.
4. Compute confidence interval for the accuracy of each model.
5. Give insights about how mice behavior is related to their genetic heritage.
