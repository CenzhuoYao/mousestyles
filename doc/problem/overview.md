## Motivation

Although all the human genes sets are detected and recognized, the impact of a specific gene on brain function remain undiscovered. However, genes cannot be systematically manipulated in humans, so investigating gene functions on mouse has been a regular methodology to approach the gene functions on human beings. The reason for choosing mouse as alternative organism are complex. As Dr. Tecott indicates in his paper, "As fellow mammals, mice and humans possess similar body plans, organ systems, and mechanisms of physiological regulation. ... The genomes of humans and mice are approximately 2.9 and 2.5 billion nucleotides long, respectively, and both encode approximately 30,000 genes. Approximately 99% of mouse genes have human counterparts—conversely, mouse versions (orthologs) can be identified for 99% of human genes." In addition, although humans behaviors are much more complex than mouse's, they are formed in sub units and many of which are identical to mouse's. Therefore, designing experiments to find relationship between specific genes and its related behaviors on mouse can be applied on find humans gene functions. 

## Experiments and Data

The traditional technology to analyze behaviors is time-intensive and labor-intensive. For example, recording data requires staffs to keep tracking behaviors uninterruptedly. This experiment utilized a method for continuous high-resolution
behavioral data collection and analysis, which helps the staff record the behavior in the mouse automatically and incessantly. The experiments are implemented on different strains mice which represent different gene sets. Basically, the data collected represents eating, drinking behaviors and the movements of different mice in a desinged space along 24 hours. 

## Analysis

The project utilized sophisticated statistical methods to process data, including machine learning algorithms and statistical inference. The whole project can be divided into 6 sub-projects:
 - Behavior Model
 - Exploration & Path Diversity
 - Dynamics of Active State Patterns
 - Ultradian Analyses
 - Clustering
 - Power Laws & Universality
