## Motivation

Although all the human genome was first sequenced over a decade ago, the relationship between genetics and behavior is still murky. For ethical reasons, genes cannot be systematically manipulated in humans -- enter mice. There are several reasons for choosing mice in order to better understand humans, chief among them is the fact that "approximately 99% of mouse genes have human counterparts—conversely, mouse versions (orthologs) can be identified for 99% of human genes." In addition, although human behaviors are much more complex than those of mice, they are formed in sub units that are nearly identical to behavior sub units in mice. Therefore, designing experiments to find relationship between specific genes and its related behaviors on mouse can be applied on find humans gene functions. 

## Experiments and Data

The traditional technology to analyze behaviors is time-intensive and labor-intensive. For example, recording data requires staffs to keep tracking behaviors uninterruptedly. This experiment utilized a method for continuous high-resolution
behavioral data collection and analysis, which helps the staff record the behavior in the mouse automatically and incessantly. The experiments are implemented on different strains mice which represent different gene sets. Basically, the data collected represents eating, drinking behaviors and the movements of different mice in a desinged space along 24 hours. 

## Analysis

The project utilized sophisticated statistical methods to process data, including machine learning algorithms and statistical inference. The whole project can be divided into 6 sub-projects:
 - Behavior Model
 - Exploration & Path Diversity
 - Dynamics of Active State Patterns
 - Ultradian Analyses
 - Clustering
 - Power Laws & Universality
