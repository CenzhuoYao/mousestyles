Project 2: Exploration & Path Diversity
=======================================

## Purpose
- Define and compare different mouse locomotion patterns

## Key Questions
- How to define/ characterize a path from point A to point B? What are the key features? How to cut out paths from location data? How to distinguish moving trajectories among different mouse strains (like we can measure the ‘distance’ between two densities by the KL divergence in probability)? 
- How to distinguish a point recorded to be a stop or just a progression in a path. Potential solutions are considering the recorded time of the neighboring data points. 
- Compare and contrast between mouse behaviors. What is the spatial habit of each strain? How frequently does a mouse visit/ stay at a location? How long does it stay at a specific location? What is the total distance on average a mouse travel per day? How fast on average does a mouse travel? Is it different from strain to strain? 
- Formulate hypothesis about mice with different patterns of path, and relate path diversity to other features (like feeding).

## Exploratory Questions
- What are the purposes (feeding, drinking, etc) for mice movements. Can we differentiate paths based on the purposes of movements.
- Do the kinds of mice that eat more (or drink more) also travel more (distances and frequency)?
- Can we cluster the mice based on their movement patterns? How?

## Data:
- A mice ‘movement event’ was measured as numbered in the tens of thousands per day. Each event was described by a location and time stamp when the distance from the prior recorded location exceeded 1 cm.
